                    <p>
                        A coronavirus is a virus that is found in animals and, rarely, can be transmitted from animals to humans and then spread person to person. In addition to COVID-19, other human coronaviruses have included:

The MERS virus, or Middle East respiratory syndrome.
The SARS virus, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which first occurred in the Guangdong province in southern China.

                    <h1>What causes a coronavirus infection?</h1>
                    <p>Humans first get a coronavirus from contact with animals. Then, it can spread from human to human. Health officials do not know what animal caused COVID-19.
                    
                    The COVID-19 virus can be spread through contact with certain bodily fluids, such as droplets in a cough. It might also be caused by touching something an infected person has touched and then touching your hand to your mouth, nose, or eyes.>
                    fever
                    cough
                    shortness of breath
                    chills
                    repeated shaking with chills

                    <h1> Can a coronavirus be prevented or avoided?</h1>
                    <p>Practice social distancing. Avoid people who are sick or meeting in large groups. Stay home if you are sick. Cover your cough with a tissue or cough into your upper sleeve or elbow.  Do not cough into your hands.

                        Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. Avoid touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.
